# WiFi Connectvity on NodeMCU - Networks Project

This readme file provides an overview of the Networks project, outlining its specifications and functionality.

## Specifications

- Team: 2 members
- Arduino Board: NodeMCU ESP8266
- Purpose: Home automation solution
- Functionality: Control a relay using the NodeMCU ESP8266 board as a web server

## Project Overview

The Networks project is a home automation solution developed by a team of two members. The project utilizes the Arduino board, specifically the NodeMCU ESP8266, as the main hardware component. The objective of the project is to control a relay connected to a breadboard through a web interface.

## Functionality

The main functionality of the project is to enable remote control of the relay via a website hosted on the NodeMCU ESP8266 board. The board acts as a web server, allowing users to interact with the relay through the web interface. Users can send commands to the board via the website, triggering the relay to switch on or off.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Networks project, follow these steps:

1. Set up the NodeMCU ESP8266 board according to the manufacturer's instructions.
2. Connect the relay module to the appropriate pins on the board and the breadboard.
3. Clone or download the project code from the designated repository.
4. Open the project code in the Arduino IDE.
5. Customize the necessary variables such as Wi-Fi credentials and relay pins to match your setup.
6. Upload the code to the NodeMCU ESP8266 board.
7. Ensure that the board is connected to a power source.
8. Access the assigned IP address of the board through a web browser.
9. Use the web interface to control the relay connected to the breadboard.

## Contributions

This project was a collaborative effort between two team members. Each member contributed to various aspects of the project, including hardware setup, software development, and testing.

## Conclusion

The Networks project demonstrates the implementation of a home automation solution using the NodeMCU ESP8266 board as a web server to control a relay. By following the provided instructions, users can set up the project and utilize the web interface to remotely control the relay connected to the breadboard.
